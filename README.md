## 🛣️ **Data Structures Roadmap (Beginner to Advanced)**

---

### 🔰 **Stage 1: Foundation – Prerequisites**

> 🧠 Goal: Understand the basics of programming and how memory works.

#### Topics:

* **Basic Programming Concepts** (Using Python, C++, or Java)

  * Variables, Loops, Conditionals
  * Functions, Recursion
* **Memory and Computation Basics**

  * Stack vs Heap memory
  * Time & Space Complexity (Big O Notation)

#### Practice:

* [Learn Big-O Notation (Visually)](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)
* Solve beginner problems on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) or [LeetCode Easy](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?difficulty=Easy)

---

### 🧱 **Stage 2: Core Data Structures (Linear)**

> 🧠 Goal: Master fundamental linear data structures and their use cases.

#### Topics:

* **Arrays**

  * Static vs Dynamic Arrays
  * Insertion, Deletion, Searching
* **Linked Lists**

  * Singly, Doubly, Circular
* **Stacks**

  * Using Arrays/LinkedLists
  * Valid Parentheses, Undo Operation
* **Queues**

  * Normal Queue
  * Circular Queue
  * Deque (Double-Ended Queue)
  * Priority Queue (Basic Intro)

#### Practice:

* Implement each from scratch.
* Solve problems from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/) and LeetCode tags.

---

### 🌲 **Stage 3: Non-Linear Data Structures**

> 🧠 Goal: Learn tree and graph-based structures and traverse them effectively.

#### Topics:

##### 🧮 Trees:

* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree (BST)
* Traversals: Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, Level-order (BFS)
* Height, Diameter, Mirror, Balance, etc.
* **Advanced Trees**

  * AVL Tree, Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree (BIT)
  * Trie (Prefix Tree)

##### 🧭 Graphs:

* Representation: Adjacency List vs Matrix
* Traversal: BFS, DFS
* Shortest Path: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall
* Minimum Spanning Tree: Kruskal’s, Prim’s
* Union-Find (DSU)
* Topological Sort, Cycle Detection

#### Practice:

* Visualize on [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en)
* LeetCode Tree & Graph problems

---

### 🧮 **Stage 4: Hashing & Maps**

> 🧠 Goal: Use hashing for constant time lookups.

#### Topics:

* Hash Table (Open Addressing, Chaining)
* HashMap vs HashSet
* Applications:

  * Anagrams
  * Two Sum, Subarrays with Given Sum
  * Caching (LRU Cache)

#### Practice:

* Implement a custom hash function.
* LeetCode: [Top HashMap Problems](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/)

---

### 🔁 **Stage 5: Advanced Techniques & Structures**

> 🧠 Goal: Explore specialized structures for competitive programming and system design.

#### Topics:

##### Heaps:

* Min-Heap & Max-Heap
* Heapify
* Priority Queue Applications

##### Disjoint Sets (Union-Find):

* Path Compression
* Union by Rank

##### Segment Trees / Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree):

* Range Query and Update
* Applications in CP & Competitive Sites

##### Tries:

* Word Dictionary
* Autocomplete
* IP Routing

##### Suffix Arrays & Trees:

* Pattern Matching
* Longest Common Prefix

---

### 📊 **Stage 6: Application-Based Data Structures**

> 🧠 Goal: Learn DS used in **real-world systems**.

#### Topics:

* LRU Cache using LinkedHashMap / DLL + HashMap
* Inverted Index (used in Search Engines)
* B-Trees (used in DBMS)
* Skip Lists
* Bloom Filter (used in Redis, Cassandra)

---

### ⚙️ **Stage 7: Real-World + Project Implementation**

> 🧠 Goal: Apply DS in real-world scenarios, coding interviews, and systems.

#### Suggestions:

* Build:

  * Text Autocomplete (Trie)
  * Task Scheduler (Heap + Queue)
  * URL Shortener (Hashing + DB)
  * Spell Checker (Trie + Edit Distance)
* Start contributing to open-source or coding clubs
* System Design: Learn how DS like Hash Tables, Queues, and Trees power services like Google, Netflix, etc.
