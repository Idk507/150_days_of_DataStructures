## 🔢 1. What are **Bits**?

A **bit** is the smallest unit of data in computers. It’s either:
- `0` (off)
- or `1` (on)

Everything you see in a program (numbers, text, etc.) is stored as bits.

👉 **Example**  
The number `5` in binary is:
```
5 → 101 (binary) → means bit positions: [2^2, 2^1, 2^0] = [4, 0, 1]
```

So:
```
5 = 0b0101
```

---

## ⚙️ 2. What is **Bit Manipulation**?

Bit manipulation is the process of **changing**, **checking**, or **toggling** bits using **bitwise operators**.

### 🔧 Common Bitwise Operators:

| Operator | Symbol | Description                          |
|----------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| AND      | `&`    | Both bits must be 1                  |
| OR       | `|`    | At least one bit is 1                |
| XOR      | `^`    | Bits are different                   |
| NOT      | `~`    | Flip all bits                        |
| Left Shift  | `<<` | Shift bits to the left (multiply by 2) |
| Right Shift | `>>` | Shift bits to the right (divide by 2)  |

---

### ✅ Examples:

```python
a = 5      # 0101
b = 3      # 0011

print(a & b)  # 0101 & 0011 = 0001 → 1
print(a | b)  # 0101 | 0011 = 0111 → 7
print(a ^ b)  # 0101 ^ 0011 = 0110 → 6
print(~a)     # ~0101 → 1010 (2's complement) → -6 in Python
```

---

## 🎭 3. What is **Bitmasking**?

Bitmasking is a technique to use bits as **flags** or **switches** — on/off states.

Each **bit position** represents a **property, state, or element**.

👉 Example:
Imagine you have 4 cities:
- City 0 → bit 0
- City 1 → bit 1
- City 2 → bit 2
- City 3 → bit 3

So:
- `0000` = visited no city
- `0101` = visited city 0 and 2

### 📌 Use-cases:
- Track visited items
- Check presence
- Subset generation
- Optimization in DP

---

### 🔍 Bitmasking Essentials:

#### ✅ Set a bit (mark visited)
```python
mask = mask | (1 << i)
```

#### ✅ Unset a bit (mark unvisited)
```python
mask = mask & ~(1 << i)
```

#### ✅ Toggle a bit
```python
mask = mask ^ (1 << i)
```

#### ✅ Check if bit is set
```python
if (mask & (1 << i)) != 0:
    # bit i is set
```

## 🧠 4. Why Learn Bit Manipulation & Bitmasking?

Because it makes problems faster and smarter to solve — especially:
- **Subset Problems**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph algorithms**
- **Competitive programming**

It helps reduce time complexity from `O(n!)` to `O(2^n)` in many problems — like TSP, Subset Sum, etc.

|-------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Set bit `i`       | `mask |= (1 << i)`           | Turn on bit i               |

## 🎯 Want to Practice?

Here are a few beginner-level challenges:
1. Count number of set bits in a number
2. Generate all subsets of a set using bitmasking
3. Check if a number is a power of 2
4. Find the single non-repeating number (using XOR)
5. Use bitmask DP for simple problems like **minimum path with visited nodes**


Awesome Dhanush! Let’s go through **each of these 5 beginner-level bit manipulation/bitmasking problems**, step by step with simple examples and code. These will build your confidence and understanding 💪

---

### 🧮 1. **Count number of set bits in a number**

**Goal**: Count how many `1`s are in the binary representation.

#### Example:
```python
n = 13  # binary: 1101 → has 3 set bits
```

#### Code:
```python
def count_set_bits(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        count += n & 1  # add last bit
        n >>= 1         # right shift to remove last bit
    return count

print(count_set_bits(13))  # Output: 3
```

✅ **Why it's useful**: Many bitmask DP problems use this to count how many things are selected (e.g., cities visited).

---

### 📦 2. **Generate all subsets of a set using bitmasking**

**Goal**: For a set `[a, b, c]`, generate all subsets using bits.

#### Explanation:
There are `2^n` subsets. For `n = 3`, binary numbers from `000` to `111` will represent all subsets.

#### Code:
```python
def generate_subsets(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for mask in range(1 << n):  # from 0 to 7
        subset = []
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & (1 << i):
                subset.append(arr[i])
        print(f"{mask:03b}: {subset}")

generate_subsets(['a', 'b', 'c'])
```

✅ Output:
```
000: []
001: ['a']
010: ['b']
011: ['a', 'b']
...
111: ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

✅ **Why it's useful**: Powerful way to generate combinations/subsets efficiently in O(2^n).

---

### 🔍 3. **Check if a number is a power of 2**

**Idea**: Powers of 2 have **only one bit set**.

#### Examples:
- `4 = 100` ✅
- `5 = 101` ❌

#### Trick:
If `n` is a power of 2:
```python
n & (n-1) == 0
```

#### Code:
```python
def is_power_of_two(n):
    return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0

print(is_power_of_two(4))   # True
print(is_power_of_two(5))   # False
```

✅ **Why it's useful**: Helps optimize loops and base case checks in binary logic.

---

### ⚡ 4. **Find the single non-repeating number using XOR**

**Problem**: Given an array where every number appears twice except one, find the unique number.

#### Example:
```
arr = [2, 3, 5, 3, 2] → Output: 5
```

#### XOR Trick:
- `a ^ a = 0`
- `a ^ 0 = a`

So if we XOR all elements, duplicates cancel out.

#### Code:
```python
def find_unique(arr):
    result = 0
    for num in arr:
        result ^= num
    return result

print(find_unique([2, 3, 5, 3, 2]))  # Output: 5
```

✅ **Why it's useful**: Great for interview rounds — simple and powerful!

---

### 🚗 5. **Bitmask DP: Minimum Path with Visited Nodes (Mini-TSP)**

**Problem**: Given distances between cities, find minimum cost to visit all cities and return.

Let’s say:
```python
dist = [
    [0, 10, 15, 20],
    [10, 0, 35, 25],
    [15, 35, 0, 30],
    [20, 25, 30, 0]
]
```

We can use a bitmask `mask` to track visited cities. Let `dp[mask][i]` = min cost to reach `i` with cities in `mask` visited.

#### Code:
```python
import sys

def tsp_dp(dist):
    n = len(dist)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]

    # base case: start at city 0
    dp[1][0] = 0

    for mask in range(1 << n):
        for u in range(n):
            if mask & (1 << u):  # city u is visited
                for v in range(n):
                    if not (mask & (1 << v)):  # city v not visited
                        new_mask = mask | (1 << v)
                        dp[new_mask][v] = min(dp[new_mask][v], dp[mask][u] + dist[u][v])

    # Return to start city
    final_mask = (1 << n) - 1
    return min(dp[final_mask][i] + dist[i][0] for i in range(n))

print(tsp_dp([
    [0, 10, 15, 20],
    [10, 0, 35, 25],
    [15, 35, 0, 30],
    [20, 25, 30, 0]
]))
```

✅ Output: `80` (Minimum cost path: 0 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 0)
